# Plant-Disease-Detection
Leaf disease detection is a crucial aspect of agricultural science, aimed at safeguarding crops from various diseases that can significantly impact yield and quality. The early and accurate identification of leaf diseases can help farmers and agronomists take timely and appropriate measures to control and mitigate the spread of infections, ensuring healthy plant growth and sustainable agricultural practices.

This project focuses on developing an automated system for detecting leaf diseases using advanced image processing and machine learning techniques. By capturing images of leaves and analyzing their morphological features the system can identify patterns and symptoms indicative of specific diseases. The core methodology involves preprocessing the leaf images to enhance quality and extract relevant features followed by applying machine learning algorithms such as Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) for classification.

Key features of this project include the creation of a comprehensive dataset comprising images of healthy and diseased leaves labeled with the corresponding disease types. The model is trained on this dataset to learn the distinguishing characteristics of various leaf diseases. Once trained the system can accurately diagnose diseases in new leaf samples providing real time feedback to users.

This automated leaf disease detection system not only enhances the accuracy and speed of diagnosis but also reduces the reliance on expert knowledge making it accessible to a broader range of users including small scale farmers. By leveraging the power of AI and machine learning this project aims to contribute to the global efforts in improving agricultural productivity and food security.
